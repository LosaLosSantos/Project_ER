## Overview: 
This project aims to analyze economic development indicators of various countries over time using Python programming language. 
The dataset used in this project contains information on various economic indicators such as GDP, Human Development Index (HDI), 
mineral rents, natural gas rents, population, etc. The primary goal is to understand the relationships between these indicators 
and explore patterns in the data. Additionally, a linear regression model is built to predict GDP values based on selected independent variables.
